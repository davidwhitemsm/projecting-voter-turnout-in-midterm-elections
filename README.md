***About this Project***

I used data from the US Census Bureau and the Georgia Secretary of State’s office to build a machine learning model that predicts voter turnout in midterm elections. My goal was to develop a method of projecting turnout that is more predictive than simply averaging the turnout totals of the last three similar elections.
